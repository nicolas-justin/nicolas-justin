## Hi there 👋

I'm Nicolas Justin, but you can just call me Nick 😉. I'm a software developer, and I'm deeply involved in the world of coding 👨‍💻.

Right now, I'm specializing in cool technologies like React.js, React Native, TypeScript, Node.js, and a bunch of other tools that make up the JavaScript wonderland ✨.

My professional journey has led me to a profound appreciation for UI/UX and related matters. Currently, I hold the position of Software Engineer at [Sicredi](https://www.sicredi.com.br/), where I actively contribute to crafting digital solutions.

I'm not just about code though 😄. So, I'm always open to making new connections, having a good chat, and sharing what I know. Got a cool project in mind or just want to talk tech? Feel free to reach out to me through any of my social channels. I promise to respond as soon as possible ⚡.

Looking forward to connecting,\
Nick
