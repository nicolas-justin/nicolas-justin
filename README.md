# Hey there üëã

## Welcome to my profile

My name is Nicolas Justin (aka Nick) from Brazil, I'm a Software Developer with expertise in React.js, React Native, TypeScript, Node.js and other tools in the JavaScript ecosystem, currently working as a Front-end Developer at [@zaply-dev](https://github.com/zaply-dev).

I'm also a lover of UX/UI and related areas, in my spare time, if I'm not working on a personal project, I'll probably be writing on my blog.

I love making new friends, chatting and sharing knowledge or participating in projects, feel free to contact me on any of my social networks, I will respond as soon as possible.
